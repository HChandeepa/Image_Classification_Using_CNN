# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with TensorFlow
This project demonstrates the process of classifying images using the CIFAR-10 dataset with TensorFlow. We explore the differences in performance between a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Project Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. Our goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing:

-Load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
-Normalize the image data to improve model performance.
## ANN Model Training:

-Build a simple Artificial Neural Network to serve as a baseline.
-Train the ANN model and evaluate its performance on the test data.
-Observe the accuracy and identify the limitations of using an ANN for image classification.
## CNN Model Training:

-Design a Convolutional Neural Network tailored for image classification.
-Train the CNN model on the same dataset.
-Evaluate the CNN's performance and compare it with the ANN.
## Performance Comparison:

-Compare the accuracy, loss, and general performance of the ANN and CNN models.
-Understand why CNNs are preferred for image classification tasks.
## Conclusion
-Through this project, you'll gain a better understanding of why Convolutional Neural Networks outperform Artificial Neural Networks in image classification tasks. The step-by-step approach will help you appreciate the advantages of using CNNs, especially when working with visual data.
